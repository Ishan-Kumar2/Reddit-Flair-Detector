If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.\n",

      "4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.\n",

We had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with.

Even if you promise to pay them above the market rate, make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials, they are not willing to work for it. And I'm not talking about overtime or anything.. Just their normal work cycle. They are not serious about it at all.\n",

Within a month I was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit.

It could begin with people in WhatsApp groups reporting someone at a \\*.gov.in for sharing a dissenting article that they deem fake news, but in the process blacklisting the sharer in the govt's eyes. This could then snowball into folks being rewarded for doing their patriotic duty when they snitch on critics of the BJP or Hindutva, possibly by doxxing them or carrying out similar town square rituals of violation.

      "I have seen a lot of commentary online about how these taali banging and candlelight events show Modi’s unparalleled popularity and what it means for the future of our democracy. While it is true Modi is an extremely popular politician, I don’t think these events are the best way to measure it. Here is why:\n",
      "\n",
      "* To begin with, most national leaders see a spike in their popularity when the country is facing a crisis. This is commonly known as [Rally 'round the flag effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_%27round_the_flag_effect). (For example, Trump, even after his colossal mismanagement in dealing with the Corona virus outbreak, has seen an increase in his approval ratings). Sadly, this makes the pandemic a good opportunity for populists and fascists to seize more power, and that should worry us. ([For Autocrats, and Others, Coronavirus Is a Chance to Grab Even More Power](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/world/europe/coronavirus-governments-power.html))\n",
      "\n",
      "* Only a small percentage of people understand the semi-political nature of these events. For most people these were non-political events to fight Corona virus. Many people who might vote for other parties also took part in these events for a variety of reasons, including and not limited to love for the country (Rally 'round the flag effect), peer pressure, manufactured consent through media, boredom etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "* These events happened at a time when the entire country is under lockdown (something like this probably wouldn't be as successful as it was if there was no lockdown). People are locked in the house and glued to the TVs. Modi Govt used this situation to communicate and seek support for his events by non-stop media coverage. It didn’t matter which news channel you watched in the last few weeks, you couldn’t escape the marketing for these events. Dozens of popular film stars, sportspersons, religious leaders, etc were deployed to spread awareness and seek support for these “non-political” events. I doubt many of these celebrities will openly lend their support for Modi’s other openly political projects like CAA or NRC.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Many news channels also portrayed the act of lighting the lamps as a prayer to the God to help fight the virus. Given how religious this country is and the situation we are in, the message was naturally persuasive for many people. **This is what really forced some in my family to light the lamps, not the message of solidarity or politics**. A few news outlets packaged yesterday’s event primarily as a prayer more than anything else and that worked.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Opposition, whatever little is left, couldn’t openly oppose these events. The either unenthusiastically supported them or just kept quiet. That won’t necessarily be the case under normal circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "* It is my assessment that the **devastating effects of the pandemic on the economy will have infinitely more impact on Modi's political future** then these marketing events. A lot of potential political damage to Modi on this would also depend on the performance of Congress as an opposition, and that’s a sign of worry given the state of the grand old party.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Modi’s popularity is a by-product of a compromised media ecosystem. These PR stunts by Modi and the communalization of the outbreak proved that once again. So, in my view, **it’s the death of independent media that should worry us more than Modi’s popularity, as the latter stems from the former**. Sadly, I don’t see a solution for the media problem anytime soon. On the bright side, Modi’s popularity doesn’t automatically translate into victories in state elections for the party. We have seen that in the recent assembly elections where BJP lost despite major political events like the dilution of the Article 370 and the Ram Mandir verdict.\n",

      "To conclude – No, 2024 Lok Sabha election results were not announced yesterday.\n",

      "The above, is what scientific temper is all about. It gives us the option of questioning everyone and everything. This has been drilled into me and other researchers by our respective research advisers - to never accept anything until you can prove it to yourself, until you can convince yourself of the validity of the idea presented in a research paper. No matter how successful/popular the author of the paper is, no matter how well cited a paper is, don't trust the presented results until you can prove it to yourself - either by deriving the proof yourself or by writing the code, doing the experiments and reproducing the results yourself.\n",

      "A scientific temper teaches you to question everyone - from your parents, then your teachers, to your Governments. \n",

They act as if they care so much about the nation that they won't let that person become anti-nationalist, change his thinking and be a help for the country. Mind it, it's all happening on the social media, but in the real-life you'll see the same set of people breaking the rules, throwing away garbage here and there, when asked about justifying their these acts lead to a \" kya fark padta hai\" attitude.

      "\n",
      "**Tl;dr:** The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state. The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, deals with financial relations between the Union Government and State Governments.\n",

      "The XV-FC recommended creation of a new “disaster mitigation and response fund” 💰 at Union (NDRMF) and State levels (SDRMFs).\n",
      "\n",
      "These new funds are distinct from the O.G. 😎 'National Disaster Response Fund' (NDRF) and SDRFs under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The NDRF and SRDFs are for \"*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*”\n",

      "The NDRMF and SDRMF are for *\"local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*\" Large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the Union and State Governments.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Note 1*: The difference here lies in the words **response** (NDRF/SDRF) and **mitigation** (NDRMF/SDRMF). Mitigation is pre-disaster. Mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Note 2*: The NDRMF/SDRMF are statutory (legal) funds under the Disaster Management act, 2005 📝. Just like the NDRF and SDRFs.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Note 3*: the Supreme Court 👨‍⚖ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (🙄) directed the creation of a National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) and state SDMFs. This was criticized a lot cause the court’s got no business in the executive 💼 working. This direction was not followed by most governments in India, and has remained a non-starter 🚫\n",

Incidentally, I'm Canadian. I'm about to graduate from university. Once I do, I want to live with him again. The only way I can do that with my credentials is get married.

We usually buy everything that we need on Amazon, but sex toys aren't available there. I recently bought a vibrator (it was called body massager) from Amazon and it was very bad. All other sex toys on Amazon look to be of cheap quality and I don't want to buy it from there. We want a website/store which sells sex toys exclusively. We would like to buy different toys like the rabbit ears vibrator, the prostate massager, and explore other different toys to use in bed. Is there any trusted website/store where we can buy sex toys? I looked up on Google and saw a few websites where the toys were very expensive but at the same time, the websites looked sketchy. I dont mind paying for all those sex toys, but I don't want to get cheated and lose my money. If I get the toys home, it'll be worth it.

Among the rest, if you just see the initial list of dead people from corona, you will see a lot of them (if not most) had visited Saudi Arabia or other Muslim countries. As you might know, Muslims are already blamed for almost every historic and bad events.

The number of fake news which tries to show that Muslims are deliberately trying to harm Hindus is already bad.\n",

Not that Hindus or other religions did not do something like that - Hindus got together in Vaishno Devi, they got together in many festivals, they got together during gaumutra party, they got together for 'thali bajaa'ing. But there has been no cases linked to any of those events.

People might say \"Look at those immoral westerners. They have been punished for their immoral lifestyle by karma. That is why India, such a holy land, hasn't been greatly affected by it apart from those Muslims and Chinese who brought that disease to India!\". This narrative might gain a lot of attention.

From what I know, most Hindus have been highly tolerant and accepting people of all faiths and races historically. Why has Hinduism been hijacked by Hindutva now? A lot of people generally just want to stick to their culture and principles, which their religion & patriotism gives them, but they are being misled by the Hindutva brigade, that you need to be intolerant if you want to be a good Hindu or a good patriot for that matter.

However, being an admirer of only the beautiful, the middle class Indian and their news, is carefully sanitized of any mention about these starving, sun-burnt wretches that cannot even afford the diet provided to one commercial European cow. The Indian farmer is invisible in life and in death. Thus, while his ripe, turgid oranges reach the gentleman's table, this abomination of a human being vanishes into obscurity, thrashed and ravaged by a burden of debt as the content hungry Indian media looks at the shopping malls and celebrity gossip to fill their pages.\n",

      "I do not intend to ruin the appetite of my fine, educated compatriots on this forum, by whining the demise of a two penny cotton, orange farmer from India, I am here to enlighten you all on the ways of making these useless deaths profitable: the Monsanto way!\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 1990s, Monsanto, ventured into India with its variety of genetically modified cotton seeds: BT cotton. In this introductory episode, I would skip the illegalities of Monsanto's field trials in India for which the Indian supreme court suspended Monsanto's Indian trading rights until 2001.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to 2002: Monsanto's agents start approaching Vidarbha's farmers about these BT cotton seeds (later known as suicide seeds). The seeds were expensive, but Monsanto had already arranged with Indian banks for huge loan provisions to farmers who agreed. The farmers were promised unimaginable profits from these super-seeds, mostly verbally. Most importantly, Monsanto's agents were nice, personable and they actually addressed the Indian farmers as if they were human beings. When you are nice to the poor, you take away their bargaining power. Unable to read or write, these gullible, uneducated farmers put their thumb-print (in lieu of their signature) on Monsanto's agreement and approached banks for loans several times their annual revenue. The loans were all approved without any hurdle. The farmer was literally on a joyride, for the first time in several generations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the eyes of the erudite, this was a picture perfect move. In one sweep, millions of dollars of public money lying in the local banks became Monsanto's money, riding on shoulders of half-naked cotton farmers of Vidarbha.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then reality struck: the crops failed, they failed miserably. When the farmers approached the same agents for answers, the attitude was different from last time. The agents pointed the illiterate farmer, who is unable to even sign his name, to a clause built into page x, line y of the initial document. The clause redeemed Monsanto of failed harvest unless the farmer had also bought Monsanto's very expensive fertilizer and pesticide as well. The news broke as hellfire on the destitute farmer that was already on the brink of devastation from three failed cotton harvests. There was no way for the farmer to afford these expensive fertilizers and pesticides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously, when the farmers approached the banks and local politicians on Monsanto's payroll, both referenced the same documents with the thumb print of the farmers and held the farmer alone responsible for their debt.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have decided to read on, let me warn you that there is no silver lining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until now, after each harvest, the farmers would save their indigenous seeds in local seed banks, but they have not sown indigenous for past several harvest cycles. So the older variety of indigenous seeds that the farmer sowed, are no longer to be found and worse still: Monsanto has bought over all the local seed banks. 99% of cotton exported by India is BT cotton, the indigenous varieties are all but extinct. These were the same indigenous cotton varieties that once clad Alexander’s army, the ancient Romans and the Egyptian Pharaohs. The native Indian cotton that led Europe into a global exploration for trade routes and set forth the age of explorations - is all but gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point, the Vidarbha farmers give up the fight, decide to swallow their loss and make the best of what they have. In the absence of indigenous seeds, they moved to sow the seeds from the previous Monsanto harvest. However, the friendly Monsanto agent came knocking back. The agent pointed again to another clause in the agreement that declares Monsanto's patent on the seeds and prohibits the farmers from re-sowing them. The farmer is flabbergasted, never before had they known that seeds can be patented. Farmer lobby groups took Monsanto to court. Obviously Monsanto prevailed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monsanto's victory over the naked starving Indian farmers was hugely celebrated in various disguise. Our very own Nature called it a \"boost for research\". \n",

      "The patriotic, nationalistic Modi government refuses to talk about farmer suicides. For several years, it refused to publish the suicide numbers.

Starving and diseased, the Indian farmers are an ungainly sight for three centuries now. As the British sepoy would kick these wretched souls lining the street side, the farmer would cry out in agony: \"Baba!, baba!\": \"father, father\",\" your countrymen have brought me to such misery, if it pleases you, I want to breath my last in your presence\". Like yesterday, the common people is just as engrossed in fighting each other and rioting, to be able to see the real evil plaguing them.

      "\n",
      "A few days ago the solicitor general of India put up fake and baseless allegations against Harsh Mander,the allegations were that Mr Maser had made derogatory comments that brought disrepute to the Supreme Court , the chief justice did not even hear to Harsh Mander's Lawyer and scolded Harsh Mander for bringing disrepute to the Supreme Court, they scolded him without even reading his speech and just based on what the solicitor general said. These allegations against Mr Mander was made after he made complaints of hate speeches during the Delhi Riots.\n",
      "\n",
      "Excerpts from the hearing:\n",
      "the Chief Justice of India (CJI) said: “If this is what you feel about the Court, then we will have to decide what to do about you.” He also decided to defer a hate speech petition presented by Mander. “Till we sort this out we will not hear you but will hear others.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mander’s lawyer, Dushyant Dave, pleaded with the judges: “Please go through the entire speech … the filing of the application by Delhi Police against Mander is an attempt to browbeat him … He is being put in the dock for nothing.” But, again, the Court did not hear the full speech. It continued to rely on the Solicitor General’s version now, presumably, supported by the police. And it ordered Mander to respond to the allegations and fixed an April date for the next hearing.\n",

      "We wrote to the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs to ensure reform of India’s internet shutdown laws remains a priority for the government. We have relied on the observations made by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* about gaps in the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 to urge for review of the Rules based on public consultation and economic impact assessment. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Background\n",
      "\n",
      "On 10 January 2020, the Supreme Court delivered its judgement *in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.* This case related to the constitutionality of the communication shutdown imposed in Jammu and Kashmir on 05 August 2019 and it highlighted deficiencies in India’s internet shutdown framework.  The Court noted that the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 had several gaps which needed to be addressed by the legislature including the lack of time limitation for shutdown orders. As a temporary stop-gap measure, the Court put in place two ad-hoc procedural safeguards. First, the Court directed that all internet shutdown orders should be published. Second, the Court directed the Review Committee to periodically review internet shutdown orders every seven working days. Unfortunately, even these safeguards have not been complied with uniformly and internet shutdowns have been imposed in cities like Jabalpur without any publication of order.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government seems to be aware of the import of the judgement in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* but no concrete steps have been taken so far for review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. In response to a [**parliamentary question**](https://pqars.nic.in/annex/251/AU600.pdf), the Minister of State for Communications stated in Rajya Sabha on 06 February 2020 that the government will review the Rules and conduct stakeholder consultation in view of the Supreme Court’s observations. To ensure the government follows up with this assurance, we have written to the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations for Department of Telecommunications\n",
      "\n",
      "We first wrote to the Department of Telecommunications under the Ministry of Communications on 06 February 2020 and highlighted the massive economic losses caused by internet shutdowns in India. In particular, we urged the Department to commence a public consultation to review the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. We also recommended that an urgent advisory be issued to all States and Union Territories to ensure that all internet shutdowns are ordered in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.*\n",
      "\n",
      "Noting that there was lack of any systematic record keeping by the government, we have requested the Department to maintain a repository of all internet shutdown orders and conduct an economic impact to ascertain losses caused by internet shutdowns. We suspect that the losses will be extremely high with the Cellular Operators Association of India estimating that telecom operators lose Rs. 24.5 million per hour in every circle area where there is a shutdown or throttling.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "### Recommendations for Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs\n",
      "\n",
      "We also wrote to the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs on 03 April 2020 to ensure implementation of the assurance made by the Minister of State for Communications in Rajya Sabha about review of Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. As per the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961, the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs is responsible for culling out all assurances made in Parliament, monitoring the status of their fulfilment and laying an implementation before Parliament. Assurances made in Parliament are usually required to be fulfilled within 3 months. However, in this case, the Department of Telecommunications has not taken any steps towards review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 including putting out a call for public consultation. \n",
      "\n",
      "We recognize that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the functioning of government ministries has been affected but this crisis also demonstrates how the internet has become a lifeline for many. Therefore, even if there is an extension of implementation timelines, review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 must remain a priority and the Parliament must be apprised of the status of implementation of the assurance made by the Ministry of Communications.\n",

      "\n",
      "They must have migrated from North India to Punjab and then to Peshawar and Afghanistan and beyond. Along the way other low-status communities joined with them, some speaking Punjabi but assimilated together for socio-cultural regions. \n",
      "\n",
      "According to Wikipedia, “In India, The Changar are largely a landless community, with a few still involved in their traditionally occupation of lime manufacture. Most are now daily wage labourers. Like other Rajasthani Muslims, the community has a caste association or biradari panchayat, which resolves intra community disputes and enforces communal norms. Although the Changar live in close proximity to other such Muslim castes such as the Hiranbaz, Sindhi-Sipahi and Qaimkhani, intermarriages between them and the Changar are extremely rare. The Changar are Sunni Muslims, and their customs are similar to other Rajasthani Muslims. They have been granted Other Backward Class status, which makes them subject to a number of affirmative actions policies of the Government of India”\n",
      "\n",
      "This part I believe is true: According to their traditions, the Changar left Rajasthan, with their initial settlement being in the districts of Bikaner, Churu and Nagaur. From there the Changars migrated to Sindh. A further migration then took place to Punjab, where many are still found. They speak Marwari among themselves, and Urdu with outsiders. \n",
      "\n",
      "However it is dubious to claim that many of them migrated to Persia in the Sasanian Empire, from there to Sasanian Egypt to Byzantine Empire, where there descendant's became known today as the Romani people in Turkey, who live mainly in East Thrace.[1]\n",

As much as I want to tell my parents that I am scared as to what I would do in the future, I just can't because it won't help me and would only stress them because they will start worrying and it's not like they know anything about animation and would start making calls for knowledge and help ..I don't want to give them that kind of a stress right now .\n",

With this, China’s power projection through it’s PLA Navy has increased by leaps & bounds; and so has its threat to other neighbouring countries including India.

The only problem is lack of funds as its construction & operationalization over a period of 10 years will cost a hefty 6 billion or 60,000 crore.

These allegations are further reaffirmed when the WHO chief went to Wuhan on the 13th of January 2020 and issued a formal statement that there is no human to human transmission of the Corona Virus. The above events show Trump's failing as a global leader and the recession of one of the major democratic players from the world stage.

As they were on the side of the roads they are cramped, such cramped atmosphere promoted for the spread of the disease. Now the government knows that it's going to loose this war if a vaccine doesn't come out soon, and to be very frank a vaccine will take at least 12-18 months, so now the ruling dispensation is trying to divert attention on communal grounds, helped by the fact that one religious gathering carried the Corona Virus all over the country, in the same way that a religious community spread it in South Korea.\n",

      ">गुजरात के मुख्यमंत्री के सचिव अश्वनी कुमार ने एक न्यूज एजेंसी को बताया- ‘गुजरात के अलग-अलग जिलों के करीब 1800 लोग हरिद्वार में फंसे हुए थे। केंद्रीय मंत्री मनसुखभाई मांडविया और मुख्यमंत्री विजय रूपाणी के विशेष प्रयासों से इन लोगों को वहां से निकालकर इनके घर पहुंचाने की व्यवस्था की गई।’ इसी व्यवस्था के चलते उत्तराखंड परिवहन की कई गाड़ियां हरिद्वार से अहमदाबाद पहुंची थी। दिलचस्प है कि ये काम इतनी गोपनीयता से किया गया कि उत्तराखंड के परिवहन मंत्री तक को ये खबर नहीं लगी कि उनके विभाग की कई गाड़ियां लॉकडाउन के दौरान कई राज्यों की सीमाओं को पार करते हुए 1200 किलोमीटर के सफर पर निकल चुकी हैं।\n",
      "\n",
      "Ashwani Kumar, Secretary to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, told a news agency - \"Around 1800 people from different districts of Gujarat were stranded in Haridwar. With the special efforts of Union Minister Mansukhbhai Mandaviya and Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, arrangements were made to evacuate these people to their homes.” As a result of this arrangement, many vehicles of Uttarakhand Transport reached Ahmedabad from Haridwar. Interestingly, this work was done with such secrecy that even the transport minister of Uttarakhand did not get the news that many buses of his department had traversed distances of nearly 1200 km crossing the borders of many states during lockdown.\n",
      "\n",
      ">27 मार्च को जारी एक आदेश से मालूम पड़ता है कि उत्तराखंड परिवहन की ये गाड़ियां सीधे प्रदेश के मुख्यमंत्री कार्यालय के निर्देशों के तहत गुजरात भेजी गई थीं। इनका उद्देश्य हरिद्वार में फंसे गुजरात के लोगों को उनके घर पहुंचाना था। वापस लौटते हुए यही गाड़ियां वहां फंसे उत्तराखंड के लोगों को लेकर आ सकती थी, लेकिन ऐसा कोई भी आदेश उत्तराखंड सरकार की ओर से जारी नहीं हुआ।\n",
      "\n",
      "An order issued on March 27 shows that these vehicles of Uttarakhand Transport were sent directly to Gujarat *under the instructions of the Chief Minister's Office*. Their purpose was to bring the people of Gujarat trapped in Haridwar to their homes. **While returning, the same vehicles could have brought the people of Uttarakhand stranded there, but no such order was issued by the Uttarakhand government.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Workers from Uttarakhand (working in Ahmedabad) who wished to return home during the lockdown came to know about these buses from their friends back home. \n",

      ">मुकेश कुमार बताते हैं- ‘अगली सुबह यानी 29 मार्च को करीब 10 बजे हम सब लोग इन बसों के पास पहुंच गए। हम 13 साथी एक बस थे। हमारी बस के ड्राइवर ने फिर हमसे कहा कि तुम्हें ऋषिकेश तक का कुल 18 हजार रुपए किराया चुकाना होगा। ये हमें अजीब तो लगा लेकिन हमारे पास कोई विकल्प भी नहीं था। मजबूरी थी इसलिए हम तैयार हो गए और हम 13 लोगों ने मिलकर तुरंत ही 18 हजार रुपए ड्राइवर को थमा दिए। हमें लगा था कि चलो इस मुश्किल वक्त में हम कम से कम किसी भी तरह अपने घर तो पहुंच जाएंगे। लेकिन वो भी नहीं हुआ।’\n",
      "\n",
      "Mukesh Kumar says- \"The next morning, on March 29, around 10 o'clock we all reached near these buses. We were 13 companions a bus. **The driver of our bus again told us that you have to pay a total fare of 18 thousand rupees up to Rishikesh.** We found it strange but we had no choice. We were helpless, so we got ready and we immediately gave 18 thousand rupees to the driver. We thought that at least during this difficult time, we will somehow reach home. But that didn't happen either. '\n",
      "\n",
      ">मुकेश और उनके साथियों को उत्तराखंड परिवहन की इन बसों ने अहमदाबाद से बैठा तो लिया लेकिन उत्तराखंड पहुंचने से पहले ही रात के अंधेरे में किसी को राजस्थान तो किसी को हरियाणा में ही उतार दिया। \n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of Uttarakhand, these buses dropped Mukesh and his companions midway. Some were dropped off in Harayana, and some in Rajasthan. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "> बताया जा रहा है कि गुजरात के ये तमाम लोग किसी धार्मिक अनुष्ठान में शामिल होने हरिद्वार पहुंचे थे। प्रधानमंत्री और गृह मंत्री के अपने प्रदेश से आए इन लोगों को उनका करीबी भी बताया जा रहा है। गुजरात के मुख्यमंत्री के सचिव अश्वनी कुमार के आधिकारिक बयान से भी इतना तो साफ होता ही है कि जहां देशभर में लाखों लोग यहां-वहां फंसे हुए हैं, वहीं हरिद्वार में फंसे इन लोगों को सीधा गृह मंत्री के निजी हस्तक्षेप के बाद विशेष व्यवस्था करके निकाला गया है।\n",
      "\n",
      "It is being said that all these people from Gujarat had reached Haridwar to participate in some religious ritual. These people are supposedly close to the Prime Minister and the Home Minister. **It is also clear from the official statement of Ashwani Kumar, Secretary to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, that while millions of people are trapped here and there across the country, these people trapped in Haridwar were taken out after special intervention by the Home Minister directly.**\n",
      "\n",
      ">दूसरी तरफ मुकेश कुमार जैसे लोग है, जिन्होंने अपने प्रदेश की गाड़ियों को आता देख अपने घर लौट पाने की उम्मीद पाली थी, लेकिन वो अब तक भी अधर में लटके हुए हैं।\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand there are people like Mukesh Kumar, who had expected to be able to return to their homes after seeing the buses coming from their state, but they have been stranded.\n",

      "More testing would result in more checks and readiness which was lacking till now.Recent approval of indigenous testing kits by Ms Minal D Bhonsale of Mylab which could give result in 2.5hrs is a welcome step and will help in giving clear picture of the crisis. South Korea and Singapore could contain the crisis only because of more tests and precautions thereafter.\n",

Sequencing of the whole virus has been done in four countries — the first in the USA, second in Italy, third in China and fourth in India.\n",
      "\n",
      "What they are finding is that this virus has a different genome sequencing in India compared to say Italy. This has a lot of significance because in the Indian virus, there is a single mutation occuring in the spike protein of the genome. Spike protein is the area that attaches to the human cell. One small mutation has happened, making that attachment weak. So, this will become an important factor for us in India”\n",

The amount of CO2 in the air decreased due to the lockdown and the earth is slowly going back to normal and here's our leader trying to reverse that process so in disobedience, let's just keep our lights on and do not light up the candles.

      "Please suggest\n",
      "There are a few things that have become clear in the past couple of weeks of lockdown as well as the coverage of it around India and the central government's response:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) India is headed in the same direction Spain is when it comes to Covid19, looking at the numbers it took us 8 weeks to reach 1000 cases, 4 days to reach 2000, and 2 to reach 3000+. The growth is indicative that we are going to see a massive increase in cases irrespective of whether we are in lockdown or not simply because the cases already existed prior to lockdown and now we are finally identifying the cases which have already spread prior to March 24th. the government is ill prepared, and it will show in the coming days, whether we like it or not. we will be losing more indians, we will be seeing more images of hardships being faced by the poor and by our healthcare workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) the BJP has only gone and done it again and communalised the issue. we have somehow made this the tablighi janata outbreak and have pinned everything on that when there are massive clusters of people meeting in ayodhya or BJP ministers in the south holding pujas. my point isn't \"oh look at hindus\", it's the fact that religion is irrelevant and any sort of public gathering is detrimental to us. the Media and the BJP are only focusing on the muslims further propagating the narrative that this is something which they are spreading and portraying them as the enemy of the state. \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Subramaniam Swamy and his Vice interview have highlighted the BJPs agenda in a crystal clear manner. I have personally never voted for the BJP (including in 2014) as I was always aware of the RSS manifesto that drove their agenda and now we are finally seeing 90+ years of systematic, indoctrinated bigotry become fully a part of the central government's agenda. But what is truly horrifying is going through the comments of the Vice video and watching all these bhakts condemning Vice and telling them to \"stop with social justice\" and going ahead and justifying the BJPs agenda. the bots of the BJP have gotten exactly what they wanted through such a government, these sort of exclusionary policies are not outrageous to their base but are exactly the platform the BJP has run on since the Gujarat model. They are really out here partying like it's 2002. \n",

      "through all of this there is one plea i make of you, please hold your leaders accountable. when it comes to Covid, the one thing that is obvious is that this is only the start for India. Bhakts will have their reality check because as this virus spreads it is completely indiscriminate. it will affect them, it will kill their parents, it will kill their children, it will kill them, just as much as it could kill my family, me, your family, or a mUsLiM. as the number of infections and deaths rise in India, it is our duty to consistently hold our leaders responsible for acting. do not blame anyone else. not the tabhligi jamaat goers, not the ones who went to ayodhya, hold your elected officials accountable. they are making this a communal issue when this disease is going to kill irrespective of religion. \n",

      "i write this as someone with a lot of time on their hands but a lot of angst and anxiety in my mind because of the obvious direction this country is moving towards (Covid or no Covid). but this extraordinary time provides us with the opportunity to truly test our leaders and hold them responsible for the course our country takes. i honestly want to do a lot more and genuinely find an avenue to express this sort of discontent that is not just limited to like minded people like me. I know that places like reddit and instagram can be echo chambers in a lot of ways and i want to actively break out of that. \n",

But what about states that achieve success early on and have no reported cases for a signiaficant duration of time? Is it possible for lockdown to be lifted early in such places? How perfectly can states isolate themselves from each other? If really well, then I believe going this route would benefit a lot of people.\n",
